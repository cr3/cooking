Tofu Satay:

1 tsp ground coriander
1/2 tsp ground cumin
Small piece of ginger, chopped
1cm piece fresh lemongrass chopped
1/2 tsp salt
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
1/3 cup coconut milk

Mix all marinade ingredients in a blender and pour over your tofu. Let marinate at least 1 hour-4 hours.

Take tofu out of marinade, heat a grill pan or skillet on medium high. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Brush the bottom of the pan with some lite oil, and when it starts to smoke, add the tofu pieces. Let sear on either side about 3 minutes. Take out of the skillet and pour into an oven proof baking pan, pour the marinade over the tofu and let bake in marinade about 5-7 minutes, so that the tofu absorbs the sauce.

Peanut sauce:

1 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup natural peanut butter
1.5 tbsp sugar
3/4 tbsp Thai red curry paste
1/2 tbsp tamarind paste
dash salt

Heat the coconut milk in a small pot till bubbles form. Let cook 3 minutes. Add all other ingredients and bring to a simmer. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of water to thin it out and mix it again. Let it simmer together 1-2 minutes at a low heat.

Serve immediately alongside the grilled tofu with slices of lime.
