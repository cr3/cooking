# Potato & sour cream bread

- 80g (was 1/4 cup) potatoes, mashed

- 195 g all-purpose flour
- 28g (was 3/2 tbsp) sugar
- 4g (was 1/2 tsp) salt
- 4.5g (was 2/2 tsp) yeast
- 20g (was none) water

- 115g (was 1/2 cup) sour cream
- 1/4 cup finely chopped scallion tops or fresh or dried chives
- 12.5g (was 2/2 tbsp) melted butter

Combine all of the ingredients and mix until cohesive. Knead the dough, by hand or mixer, until it's smooth, about 5 to 10 minutes. The dough will become fairly elastic, though it'll still be quite soft and sticky.

Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and allow it to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until it's quite puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk.)

Shape the dough into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.

While the bread or rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.

Bake the bread for about 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it lightly with foil for the final 10 minutes; a digital thermometer inserted into the center will read about 190°F.

Remove the bread or rolls from the oven, and brush with melted butter, if desired, for a soft, flavorful crust. Transfer to a rack to cool.
