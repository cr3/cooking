# Veg Top Pestow

- 50g of pine nuts, these are traditional, but if preferred you can use hazelnuts, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, or any other nuts you find lurking in the kitchen cupboards
- 80g of vegetable tops, you can use all of one, a mixture of some, or add in some soft herbs (like basil or parsley) if you donâ€™t have quite enough
- 1 small garlic clove, crushed
- 30g of Parmesan, grated (use a similar cheese using vegetable rennet if serving to vegetarians)
- 5-7 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, depends on the veg tops used
- salt
- pepper
- lemon juice
- 1 pinch of sugar
